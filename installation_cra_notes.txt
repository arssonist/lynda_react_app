Note you may need to manually remove /etc/rvmrc and ~/.rvmrc if they exist still.
Please check all .bashrc .bash_profile .profile and .zshrc for RVM source lines and delete or comment out if this was a Per-User installation.
Also make sure to remove `rvm` group if this was a system installation.
Finally it might help to relogin / restart if you want to have fresh environment (like for installing RVM again).`

I am applying for a junior position. I would like to emphasize that I expect to be paid according to my very limited experience, which makes me a great bargain. And even though my scores below are bad, not knowing PHP, etc, I know rails and could learn PHP.
